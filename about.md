# About Me

I’m Kian — an aspiring IT Support & Systems Technician with a passion for understanding how technology works beneath the surface.

I thrive when solving real problems, explaining solutions clearly, and building structured systems. My approach is simple: learn deeply, help people generously, and stay curious.

My path:
- Start in IT Support or Help Desk  
- Move into Systems Administration  
- Grow into Cloud (Azure/M365)
