# 👋 About Me  
I’m Kian Nematollahi — an aspiring IT Support Specialist driven by problem-solving, customer service, and continuous learning. I enjoy breaking down complex issues into clear, simple solutions that help people feel confident and supported.

My goal is to bring strong communication skills, patience, and technical curiosity to a help desk or IT support role, and grow into systems or cloud engineering over time.

Outside of tech, I love cooking, community service, and connecting with people.
