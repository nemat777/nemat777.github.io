# <span class="icon">👋</span> About Me  

I’m **Kian Nematollahi**, an aspiring IT Support Specialist who enjoys solving problems, helping people, and learning the deeper “why” behind systems.  

Growing up, I was always the person who fixed devices, explained settings, or figured out why something wasn’t working. That curiosity transitioned naturally into building labs, studying system behavior, and practicing real troubleshooting techniques.  

**My goals:**  
- Begin in IT Support or Help Desk  
- Grow into System Administration  
- Transition into Cloud (Azure/M365)  

Outside of tech, I love cooking, connecting with people, and supporting community organizations.
